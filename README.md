- Data Analysis: Identified key metrics such as total bookings, revenue, completed/canceled rides, peak hours, and ride preferences.
- Dashboard Design: Created an interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and filters to represent insights in a clear format.
- Visualization: Used dynamic visuals like bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to highlight trends and patterns.
- Insights Generation: Interpreted the visualized data to understand customer behavior, demand fluctuations, and revenue distribution.
- Final Output: Delivered a clean, user-friendly, and interactive dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Insights
1. A total of 100,000+ rides were analyzed to study booking and revenue patterns.
2. Completed rides formed the majority, while a smaller portion was canceled or pending, highlighting operational efficiency.
3. Peak booking hours were observed during morning and evening time slots, showing high customer demand in travel hours.
4. Mini and Sedan ride types were the most preferred, while luxury rides had lower usage but higher revenue contribution.
5. Revenue distribution showed that a significant share comes from completed rides, with canceled rides reducing overall performance.
6. Customer behavior analysis revealed trends in ride preferences, time patterns, and demand fluctuations across different periods.
7. The dashboard highlights areas for improvement, such as reducing cancellations and optimizing availability during peak hours.

## Final Conclusion
The OLA Dashboard successfully transforms a large dataset of over 100,000 rides into meaningful insights through interactive visualizations. It provides a clear view of key metrics such as bookings, revenue, ride status, and customer behavior patterns. The dashboard helps identify trends, peak hours, and popular ride types, supporting data-driven decision-making. Overall, it serves as a powerful tool for analyzing operational performance, improving service efficiency, and enhancing customer satisfaction in OLA’s ride-sharing operations.
