# Ola-Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard Creation using MS Excel, Power BI)
## Project Objective
To create an interactive dashboard that visualizes OLA’s ride-sharing data in a clear and meaningful way.
To analyze a large dataset of 100,000+ records for accurate and reliable insights.
To track key metrics such as bookings, revenue, completed and canceled rides, and ride preferences.
To identify customer behavior patterns, including peak booking hours and preferred ride types.
To simplify complex datasets into visual insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## Process
-	Data Import – Load the tourism dataset (single table) into Power BI.
-	Data Cleaning – Check for missing values, duplicates, and ensure data consistency.
-	Data Transformation – Create calculated columns and measures (e.g., total tourists, growth rate, revenue).
-	Dashboard Creation – Design visuals like KPIs, maps, and charts using the cleaned table.
-	Insight Generation – Analyze patterns such as top states, seasonal trends, and domestic vs. international arrivals.

## Project Insights
1.	Tourism in India shows significant variation across states, with a few states attracting the majority of visitors.
2.	Domestic tourism forms a larger share compared to international arrivals, indicating strong local travel demand.
3.	Seasonal patterns highlight peak tourist months, useful for planning resources and promotions.
4.	Revenue from international tourists contributes greatly to foreign exchange earnings.
5.	Growth trends suggest increasing opportunities for sustainable tourism and infrastructure development.
6.	State-wise analysis reveals potential regions that need more focus on promotion and facilities.

## Final Conclusion
The Tourism India Dashboard successfully provides a clear and interactive view of India’s tourism landscape. By analyzing a single dataset, it highlights key insights such as top-performing states, seasonal visitor patterns, and the balance between domestic and international tourism. The dashboard helps identify growth opportunities, supports data-driven decision-making, and emphasizes the role of tourism in India’s economic development. Overall, this project demonstrates how visual analytics can simplify complex data and guide future strategies for sustainable tourism growth.
